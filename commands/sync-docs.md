# Command: /sync-docs

## Goal
Update project-level documentation in docs/ to reflect newly implemented features, ensuring documentation stays current with the codebase.

## User Interaction Flow
1. Analyze completed specs and their implementations
2. Identify documentation that needs updating
3. Generate updates for relevant doc files
4. Confirm changes with user

## Inputs Required
- `scope`: current-spec | all-completed | specific-file
- `doc_targets`: Which docs to update (api, database, architecture, design)
- `update_mode`: append | merge | regenerate

## Outputs Generated
- Updated `docs/api.md` with new endpoints
- Updated `docs/database.md` with schema changes
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` with new components
- Updated `docs/design.md` with UI patterns (if applicable)

## Instructions for Copilot

### Step 1: Detect Context

**Follow the context-fetcher strategy from agents/context-fetcher.md:**

1. **Determine documentation scope and load foundation context:**
   - Auto-fetch foundation documents: `.github/context.md`, `.github/product.md`, `.github/best-practices.md`
   - From loaded context.md, check ACTIVE_SPEC
   - If ACTIVE_SPEC specified, focus on current spec
   - If user requested "all-completed", scan all specs with completed tasks
   - If no specs have completed tasks, suggest running /implement first

2. **Analyze implementation status using spec-specific fetching:**
   - For each target spec, load `specs/[SPEC-ID]/tasks.md`
   - Load `specs/[SPEC-ID]/lite.md` for quick reference to what was planned
   - Identify tasks marked as completed (checked boxes) with quality scores
   - Extract what was actually built vs. what was planned
   - Note any deviations, quality scores, or additional work mentioned in task notes

3. **Load existing documentation using on-demand fetching:**
   - **Contextually fetch** technical docs that need updating based on completed tasks:
     - If API tasks completed: Load `docs/api.md` for current API structure
     - If database tasks completed: Load `docs/database.md` for current schema
     - If architecture tasks completed: Load `docs/architecture.md` for current components
     - If design tasks completed: Load `docs/design.md` for current UI patterns
   - Identify existing content structure and patterns from enhanced plan.md templates
   - Note last update timestamps and what specs contributed to each doc

### Step 2: Gather Information

1. **Confirm scope and approach:**
   - "I found [X] specs with completed implementations. Should I update docs for:"
     - **Current spec only**: [SPEC-name] ([Y] completed tasks)
     - **All completed specs**: [list of specs with completion counts]
     - **Specific specs**: Let me choose which ones

2. **Identify documentation changes:**
   - Analyze completed tasks to extract:
     - **API changes**: New endpoints, modified routes, authentication changes
     - **Database changes**: New tables, schema modifications, migrations
     - **Architecture changes**: New services, changed patterns, integrations
     - **UI/Design changes**: New components, design patterns, user flows

3. **Present update plan:**
   ```
   Found changes to document:
   
   üì° API: [X] new endpoints, [Y] modifications from [specs]
   üóÑÔ∏è  Database: [X] new tables, [Y] schema changes from [specs] 
   üèóÔ∏è  Architecture: [X] new components, [Y] pattern changes from [specs]
   üé® Design: [X] new UI components, [Y] design updates from [specs]
   ```

4. **Confirm update strategy:**
   - "Which documentation should I update? (api/database/architecture/design/all)"
   - "How should I handle updates?"
     - **Merge**: Add new content, preserve existing (recommended)
     - **Append**: Add new sections at the end
     - **Regenerate**: Rebuild entire document from scratch (destructive)


### Step 3: Process and Validate

1. **Extract implementation details:**
   - **API changes**: Parse completed tasks for new endpoints, routes, authentication
     - Extract HTTP methods, paths, request/response formats
     - Identify middleware, validation, error handling patterns
     - Note any breaking changes or version impacts
   
   - **Database changes**: Analyze completed migrations and schema tasks
     - New tables with full schema definitions
     - Modified columns, indexes, relationships
     - Data migration notes and constraints
   
   - **Architecture changes**: Identify new services, components, patterns
     - New service boundaries and responsibilities
     - Changed communication patterns
     - Integration points and dependencies
   
   - **Design changes**: Extract UI components and user experience updates
     - New components with props and usage
     - Design system updates
     - User flow changes

2. **Validate content quality using loaded context:**
   - Ensure all information comes from completed tasks with quality scores ‚â•3/5
   - Cross-reference with actual implementation files and loaded best-practices.md patterns
   - Check for consistency with existing documentation style and loaded plan.md templates
   - Verify technical accuracy against loaded foundation docs (product.md, best-practices.md)
   - Ensure updates align with loaded architecture.md and technical documentation patterns

3. **Resolve conflicts and duplications:**
   - Identify overlapping content with existing docs
   - Handle conflicts between different specs
   - Merge related changes logically
   - Preserve important existing content

### Step 4: Generate Output

1. **Update documentation files:**
   - **Merge strategy**: Integrate new content into existing structure
     - Add new sections while preserving existing ones
     - Update modified sections with clear change markers
     - Maintain consistent formatting and style
   
   - **Append strategy**: Add new content at document end
     - Create clearly marked new sections
     - Include spec attribution and date stamps
     - Maintain logical document flow
   
   - **Regenerate strategy**: Rebuild complete document
     - Include all historical and new content
     - Apply consistent structure and formatting
     - Archive previous version for reference

2. **Add traceability information:**
   - Mark new content with spec source: `*Added: YYYY-MM-DD from SPEC-YYYYMMDD-slug*`
   - Include completion timestamps
   - Note any assumptions or limitations
   - Reference related tasks or implementations

3. **Update project tracking:**
   - Note documentation updates in `.github/context.md`
   - Update LAST_UPDATED timestamp
   - Track which specs have been documented and their quality scores
   - Record which foundation and technical docs were used for updates

4. **Report completion with quality assessment:**
   ```

### Sync Strategy Recommendations

- **For first-time sync**: Use regenerate strategy for clean, consistent docs
- **For incremental updates**: Use merge strategy to preserve existing content  
- **For major changes**: Use append strategy to clearly show what's new
- **For conflicting updates**: Generate separate sections, ask user to merge
